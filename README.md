Hospitality Revenue Dashboard - AtliQ Grands
Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is a luxury hotel chain that owns multiple five-star hotels across India. With a legacy spanning 20 years, the company has faced increasing pressure in the competitive hospitality industry. Strategic moves from competitors, coupled with ineffective decision-making at the management level, have caused AtliQ Grands to lose market share and revenue, especially in the luxury and business hotel categories.

To reverse this trend and regain their competitive position, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands has made the strategic decision to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence into the company's decision-making process. However, the organization currently lacks an in-house data analytics team to provide insights and recommendations.

To address this gap, AtliQ Grands has hired a 3rd party service provider (you, as the data analyst) to generate insights from their historical data and help identify areas for improvement in their revenue management.

Objective
The goal of this project is to create a Revenue Management Dashboard that provides key insights into AtliQ Grands’ performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard should help the management team make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and increase market share. You are tasked with the following:

Create the metrics as per the provided list.
Design a dashboard based on the mock-up shared by the stakeholders.
Provide additional insights beyond the mock-up that could provide added value to the company.
Task Overview
Step 1: Create Metrics
Based on the provided list of metrics, you will need to calculate and define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
Occupancy Rate
ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Room Revenue
Total Revenue
Market Share
Customer Segmentation (Business, Leisure)
Seasonality Analysis (Peak vs. Off-peak)
You will leverage the data provided (e.g., historical booking data, revenue data, customer type data) to calculate these metrics using Power BI or any other tool as specified.

Step 2: Design Dashboard
Using the mock-up provided by the stakeholders, you will design and build the dashboard in Power BI. The mock-up will give you guidance on visual design, layout, and which metrics are most critical to display. Key visualizations may include:

Bar Charts/Line Graphs to track trends in occupancy, ADR, and revenue.
KPI Indicators to highlight performance against targets.
Heat Maps for seasonality and peak demand.
Pie Charts for customer segmentation.
Step 3: Provide Additional Insights
While the metric list and mock-up provide the foundational structure of the dashboard, you should also explore additional insights that could provide extra value to the company. These may include:

Price Sensitivity Analysis to determine how changes in pricing affect bookings.
Competitor Benchmarking to compare AtliQ Grands’ performance against key competitors in the market.
Customer Sentiment using any available customer feedback data or review sentiment analysis.
Forecasting trends in occupancy, revenue, and ADR for the next quarter or year.
These insights will allow the management team to make more proactive, data-backed decisions.

Instructions
Data Import: Import the provided data into Power BI or any data visualization tool you are using.
Metric Calculation: Follow the list of metrics shared to create calculated fields or DAX measures where applicable.
Dashboard Design: Align your dashboard design with the mock-up shared. You can use Power BI’s built-in visuals like cards, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, etc., to represent data.
Provide Insights: Use your analysis skills to explore the data further and identify trends or patterns that could help AtliQ Grands improve their revenue performance.
Deliverables
Power BI Dashboard File (or other formats as required).
Documentation outlining the calculations used for each metric, any assumptions made, and any insights or recommendations derived from the dashboard.
PowerPoint/Report (Optional): A presentation of the findings, including insights and recommendations, for stakeholders to use during discussions.
Data Source Information
Sample Data File: (Include the name and format of the file, e.g., AtliQ_Grands_Data.xlsx)
Mock-up Design: (Include the name and format of the file, e.g., AtliQ_Grands_Mockup.pdf)
